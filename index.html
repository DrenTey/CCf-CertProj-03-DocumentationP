        <header>Introduction</header>
        <p>Many of the Greek and Hebrew scholars use the Biblical programs to help their research: looking for specific vocabulary, morphological forms, etc. This fact brought a great standarization and a great number of online/offline tools which can help with such a search</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Payware: BibleWorks, Accordance, Logos/Verbum</li>
          <li>Freeware: Sword, StepBible, Biblehub</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The weak point of such tools is that they presuppose more than just a knowledge of morphology: a general knowledge of syntax is needed to know what purpose does this collection of morphems means together.</p>
        <h2 class="dividerh2">Distinction Morphological/Syntactical</h2>
        <p>If I lost you already this distinction may help you. I would like to point out that from the point of view of learning the language there is a big difference between:</p>
         <table class="smalltable"><tr><th>Word in itself</th><th>Word in a sentence</th></tr>
         <tr><td>- = its form (what it is morphologically)</td><td> - = its function (what it does syntactically)</td></table>
<p>e.g, A word “good” could be analyses according to this two manners:
</p>
        <code>Morphologically: Good – adjective (a word naming/describing the state/attribute of someone/something) </code>
     <p>Yet to analyse it syntactically, you would need to provide a sentence/phrase in which it occurs. Let us analyse some sentences, to see how the syntactical function can vary with the same morphem: "good"</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Good doctor healed my son </li>
       <li>Doctor healed my good son </li>
       <li>The Good (one) will enter into the kingdom of heaven </li>
       <li>This doctor is good </li>
       <li>God makes all things good</li>
     </ul>
     <code><p><span class="bolder">Good</span> doctor healed my son - <span class="bolder">Attribute</span> of the Subject (description of the subject (i.e. of the doctor)</p>
     <p>Doctor healed my <span class="bolder">good</span> son -  <span class="bolder">Attribute</span> of the Object (description of the object (i.e. of the doctor) )</p>
     <p>The <span class="bolder">Good</span> (one) will enter into the kingdom of heaven – <span class="bolder">Subject</span> of the sentence  </p>
     <p>This doctor is <span class="bolder">good</span> - <span class="bolder">Predicate</span> of the subject (stating that the subject (doctor) is good)</p>
     <p>God makes all things <span class="bolder">good</span> –<span class="bolder">Adverbial attribute</span>  of the object (Describing the effects which action of the subject has made on the object</p>
     </code>
 <h2 class="dividerh2">Relation Morphological/Syntactical</h2>
<p>
As you can see the same word “good” can be used in many different ways. </p>
<ul>
  <li>	Grammatically speaking there is a distinction between morphology (the nature of this written word) and the syntax (the function of this written word in the sentence/phrase)</li>
  <li>The link between these two branches of grammar is actually quite strict.</li> 
    <ul><li>	It is the morphology which helps us to recognize in many languages that a particular written word will behave in a certain way</li>
      <li>for example: if we know that a particular word is a verb,</li>
        <ul><li>we know that we can conjugate it: I work, You work, He works, We work </li>
          <li>we know that we can add endings -ing to make it name a process: working </li></ul>
        <li>It is syntax which will tells that collection of particular words made sense or not.</li>
          <ul><li>	I am working today, I work today</li>
            <li>	vs….. I today working am; Working Am…,  Ant Poorly, Turns Analyses </li></ul>
          <li>	If we know what a particular word is morphologically, we know what it function syntactically can be, and in what condition.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="General_Syntax:_what_and_who">
        <header>General Syntax: what and who</header>
        <p>In a paragraph dedicated to relation of Syntax with Morphology, I said that it will be Syntactical analysis which will tell us whether the collection of the few words made sense together or not. </p>
        <p>The base presupposition of syntactical analysis is: <span class="bolder">language has communicative functions</span>. The simplest are:
          <ul><li> "stating the facts" (he walks out through the door)</li><li> or expressing to other person "what is/has been happening" (he went out through the door).  </li></ul>You can communicate as well your wishes, order someone to do something, explain regrets, etc, but the base of communication is description of reality/non-reality. The communication also follows some pragmatical rules, based probably on attention of your listener</p>
        <ul><li>The first information which normally interest your listeners is <span class="bolder">what does someone do/ what is happening</span>. The information "<span class="bolder">... is burning</span>" will trigger the attention of people around and most probably they will come back to you and ask you a question: what/who? followed by other questions: where? how much? A statemet <span class="bolder">"...escapes"</span> will catch attention of people around. <span class="bolder">This function of stating the main content of the communication has been called by many with technical term "predicate" (preaching)</span> Knowing the main content/predicate we can try to understand who,what,where, why of the communciation</li>
        <li>The second information which will interest your listeners is 
           <span class="bolder">who does this things that we mention</span>
            or <span class="bolder">whose state</span> have we described. <span class="bolder">This function of stating the subject person/thing  of the communication has been called by many with technical term "subject" (subject of predication)</span> </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Technically this two are enough to create the simplest statements. </p>
          <ul>
            <li>John sleeps.</li>
            <li>Kate runs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Without one of them instead the sentences seems incomplete</p>
          <ul>
            <li>John _____.</li>
            <li>____ runs.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>In the next section we will try to synthesize a little different functions and shows the purpose of learning well the Syntax</p>
      </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Problems_of_Standarization">
        <header>Problems of Standarization</header>
        <p> The point of studying syntax is to acquire a framework of how-to construct sentences. It's a tool to express how elements build that particular message.</p>
        <p> Unfortunately, a gross problem which every student of ancient languages probably will encounter especially if he is going to study abroad: Apart from the base (predicate + subject) there is very few standarization of other syntactical categories, and they are being named, categorized and described differenlty by different languages. This affects also how those languages are being taught: some of grammars prefer to explain syntax using only morphological terms (verb, noun, adjective, adverb etc.) since they are mostly not argued about </p>
        <code>
        Morphological categories:
          Verb, Noun, Adjective, Pronoun, Article, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction, Interjection.
          </code>
        <p>To provide such a list for Syntax is much more difficult. I would like to propose to you my own (based on received teachings and my own Greek tutoring experience).
        </p>
        <code>
        Syntactical categories of analysis of single proposition:<br />
          Subject, Predicate, Complements of Object (Direct/Indirect), Attributive Complements, Adverbial Complements, Apposition</code> 
        <p>This simple grid should suffice for the purposes of the base classification within simple phrase. There is of course always a room for expansion and specification (e.g. Verbal Predicate, Nominal Predicate, etc.) but this 6-7 category model provide a skeleton which can help avoid confusion and multiplication of categories. In the next section I will try to explain how to use this category and why they are useful</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Predicate">
        <header>Predicate</header>
        <p>In many languages the natural candidates for the predicates are verbs. Morphologically verbs are the words that name actions, states, etc. This predominance of verbs as natural predicates leads to simplification of syntactical categories as: "subject verb  object" as in different explanation of "SVO" order.</p>
        <p>Yet, stricly speaking there are two types of Predicates based on the fact that we can made a statement/predication about something in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It states (names) main happening of the sentence (VP)</li>
          <li>It states (express) equality between two things (NP)</li>
        </ol>
<p>In the first type of predication, the accent is one the happening, and for that reason the verbs are usually the best fit candidates: John ... sleeps, James runs, Tom walks his dogs.</p>
<p>In the second type of predication, the accent is one equality between Subject and something/some quality. Though the verb can be used, the accent is not on it anymore: John is a man. Kate is beautiful. Dave is hard-working man. This type of predication is usually called Nominal or Non-verbal Predication, because the accent of predication is essence/quality and not state/action (and because in some languages you do not need an express verbal form with it). </p>

<hr />
 <h2 class="dividerh2">Looking for a Predicate</h2>
<p>Okay, this is an important intro, but how does it work in practice? How do I find my predicate and sentence structure?</p>
<p>In practice, to have a sentence you need to have a subject and a predicate</p>
<p>The predicate is "the biggest fish" in the tank, and he always has a corresponding companion "hook" that is its subject</p>
<p>To evaluate if my fish is the biggest fish, you need to understand a rule that the sentence either has a verb as its predicate or in its absence a sentence has to have another predicate to be meaningful.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Verbal Predicates (that is predicates made out of verbs) are the strongest and biggest fishes. They declass other elements to role of complements/other arguments</li>
  <li>If there is no verb, there is a possibility that you have a nominal/non-verbal predication</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Another name (noun) can easily serve as a predicate, if it has corresponding subject: He (subject) _(is)__ a hunter (predicate)</li>
    <li>An adjective in specific from can also serva as predicate, if it has corresponding subject:
      He (is) hansdome. </br>
      <p>Attention, it is a step lower predicate, because actually it is an short-hand/abbreviation for 
        "he _(is)__ a handsome man" which will still made it a name predicate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Similar to adjective works participle (which is actually a verbal adjective): "he (is) hard-working"
    <li>An adverb or a prepositional phrase can sometimes serve as a predicate: "he (is) in the house" </li>
    </ol></ol>
<p>In English, most of those nominal/non-verbal predication still needs support of verb to be (that's why I've put an expression "(is). In ancient Greek, it is non necessary though a form of verb to be can be supplied explicitly. In Hebrew, using the verb "to be" will change the tense of sentence to pasts or future. Therefore it is an important trick of trade to understand how the predication actually works. </p>
<br />
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Subject">
        <header>Subject</header>
        <p>The most imortant role of subject is to identify the person/thing/group about which is being made such predication: we say "that" about "whom?". </p>
        <p>In many languages there is an explicit rule that Subject therefore should conform in its form to predicate</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The simplest example of this rule is that if predicate has plural form, its subject is also plural, and if it has singular form, its subject also is singular</li>
          <ul><li>Actually, when we speak, we think about it in opposite way: we usually think first of the subject and then we adjust the predicate: e.g. "student studies", "teachers teach", "teacher teaches", "students study". </li>
          <li>When you analyze the sentence, it is easier many times to find the predicate first, and that is why this rule is presented in this way</li></ul>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Another criteria for Subject can be its position or its form. English ask for explicit Subject verb order and you need to state the subject before verb.</p>
          <p> In Greek and some other ancient languages more decisive is the form of the noun/other element that decide if it is a good candidate for subject: for a finite verb, its subject should be in Nominative Case and has the same number as its predicate. This condition allows other pseudo-nominal elements like "nominalized adjectives" "nominalized participle" or expansions to function as subject in Greek language.</p>
          <p>In more complex sentences, this type of "nominalized elements" can occur quite often. It could create problems at the beginning. Therefore, I have decided to coin pseudo-morphological category "Noun++" which deals with those elements that not-beign "nouns" morphologically, in a specific context of the sentence function/replace them.</p>
          <table class="bigtable">
            <tr>
              <td>10</td>
              <td>NOUN++</td>
              <td>A word (noun, pronoun, adjective, participle) or a nominal expression → that in the syntax acts primarily as noun (and so… can take any syntactical function assigned to nouns: subject, direct object, nominal predicate, etc.)</td>
              <td>I see a Man, <br />
I see him,<br />
I see the poor,<br />
I see the dancing one.</td>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Complements_of_Object">
        <header>Complements of Object</header>
        <p>One of key distinction that it can be learn is the dictinction between "direct" and "indirect" object.</p>
        <p>The secret to understand this two complements of object is again connected to predicate (they complement i.e. made it fuller). If we are have a verbal predication, the verb describes an action/state which can have following directions:</p>
        <ol><li>no external direction: Verb describe intransitive activity of the subject:
"Paul sleeps", "Charles runs", "Damian works"
        </li>
        <li>exercising effect on some object: Verb needs an object for its action, "Paul kick (what?) ball", "Charles copies (what?) letter", "Damian cures (what?) wounds". </li>
        <li>exercising effects on some object for the sake of other object: "Paul send letter to Charles", "Charles reads the letter to Damian", "Damian nods his head at Paul"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If we looked at it again, we can syntethize it as following:</br></p>
        <code>In the first case, we do not have any complement of object. In the second case, we have a complement of direct object, for with an action someone exercise direct influence on an object. In the third case, we have two complement of object: one direct, for an action exercise direct influence on object, one indirect, for this action has been accomplish with an aim/direction/addressee (which it influences only indirectly)</code>
        </br>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Attributive_Complements">
        <header>Attributive Complements</header>
        <p>Till now, all the times we have been speaking about arguments or complements of the predicate (answering the questions raised by predicate: who? whom? to whom?). Yet, there is also a way to enrich, describe more non-predicative elements, or more specifically any nominal elements.</p>
        <p>In English, the easiest way to do describe something better is to identify it with possesive or with an adjective. The same happens in Greek and the attributive complements are usually "adjectival elements" or "genitive".</p><p>The beauty of using attributive complements that they can also be attributively complemented, creating a long and beautiful sentences</p>
        <p>I desided to call this section of syntax, Attributive Complements thanks to inspiration taken from Prof. Pagliari lesson of Hebrew III and book of Walkte - O'Conner in which author claimed that syntax could be summarized in four aspects: subject, predicate, attributive modifiers, adverbial modifiers. </p>
        <p>Though, it seems to me to be a little confusing and not-helping with systematiziation, his insights is mostly right: there is a difference btween adverbial and attributive modifiers. Yet instead of modifier I prefer to say complement, for a specific reason: this term is being used for complement of specification (Genitive of specification), for adverbial complements of place, time, purpose, and even for objective complements. In this sense, it is better to use the term that is well known in other languages and help focus other to see that there is difference between this three groups od complements (objective, attributive, adverbial) rather than coining a new term which now will need to be translated and adapted in different language systems.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Adverbial_Complements">
        <header>Adverbial Complements</header>
        <p>The last category of complements are the adverbial complements. Its name came from "adverbs", elements that "limit" or "describe verbs" </p>
        <code>The word limit came from the fact that by further describing conditions of action we limit it:</br>
        I run. (wherever)
        I run in the park. (that is not in the street or wherever)
        I run in the night. (that is not in the day)
        I run for fun. (and not for money, for fame, or for well-being.)
        </code>
        <p> There is a great number and variety of adverbial complements. In certain language there exists the order of placing them, in Greek not really.</p> 
      </section>
       <section class="main-section" id="Disclaimer">
        <header>Disclaimer</header>
        <p>On this website I have put into fonts a long time of studying, work and teaching that I had received and I have handed over.</p>
        <p>I am greatly indebted to my teachers and professors, both in the seminary and in PUG, specially Greek and Hebrew Teachers (Pagliari, Poggi) who taught me a lot that I know about Syntactical Analysis. They have introduced me into the notions of predicate, subjects, complements, adverbial/attributive modifiers. Prof. Poggi book was really important for me to understand how important are predicates. Other person who were also instrumental were prof. Roland Meynet, prof Jean-Pierre. Sonnet, and prof. Luca Mazzinghi</p>
         <p>Of course, they in turn have references different writers and professors, and also myself I have always made references to a list to writers and manuals, reflecting and trying to catch up the best way to see it. Reflecting upon it, I have tried to synthetize what I have received from such a great array of sources into this short overview which I present to you, knowing that it is probably not the most quick.  As old proverbs says "We are dwarves on the shoulders of the giants", this work is build on a great wisdom/knowledge that I have received from my teacher
         <p>In a short, it could be a futile to try to remember every possible source that inspired me to coin such a synthesis (since I used now mostly my memory and old notes that I used to teach), but I would still like to made references to different position that help me to understand (apart from courses of Pagliari i Poggi) how does syntax works in Ancient Languages </p>
