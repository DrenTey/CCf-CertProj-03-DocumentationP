# CCf-CertProj-03-DocumentationP
Project done for Responsive Web Design Certification from freeCodeCamp

## Aim of the project:
The goal of the second project was to ** build a webpage representing _a technical documention/or manual_ to some issues**.  
The main conditions as far as I remember were:
- It has to have a left-side navigation bar (nav) which on the big/medium screens will be fixed to the left side of the display, and on small screens/ mobile phones will be at the top of display, and then it will disappear when looking at other content. 
- The navigation bar has to have as much hyperlinks as there is sections in the documents, but there have to be at least 5 sections in the document.
- Within 5+ sections of the document there have to be certain amount of "li" elements (list index of order/undorder lists), certain amount of "code" elements, and of paragraphs?
- There should be strict correlation between the names of the links and the sections of the document.

I was left free to decide upon colours and styles of the form.
As always the condtions for this certificate projects were:
- It had to be a personal work, using the knowledge learned through previous lessons. 
- It had to be build using html5 and css3.

 ## Website:
In this repository you can see the code of the project (index.html and styles.css).  
If you wonder how does the website look like, I deployed it  (making it live) through one of the options of profile on github.  
The link: https://drentey.github.io/CCf-CertProj-03-DocumentationP/  
Currently it can be seen also as a small internal website (iframe) on my website of my profile on github where I try to put recent project.

## Choice of the topic:
I have decided to dedicate this technical page to explanation of "technical terms" of syntax. I have found out, working with my collegues or teaching the students, that this is a big issue in learning ancient langauges: to study ancient languages (in aim of learning to translate texts), you need to have already a basis -> understanding of syntactical categories and relations.  
This understanding is not always perfectly there, and the root sometimes appeared to be traced to one of two roots:
1. The societies and nations had differently structures their home-language curriculum:
   - some countries like Poland or Italy insisted on teaching syntax in their home-language curriculum
   - some English-speaking country (like Great Britain/USA) historically have been teaching Latin/Greek in the schools and the way the syntax works has been "worked out" by learning those ancient languages. With the disappearence of Latin/Greek from school curriculum, the teaching of syntax could get lost. 
2. Simplification of Grammar to relation within morphology only:
   - Many languages today use the so called SVO order to determine syntactical relations. Ancient languages and some modern (e.g. slavic languages) had different mechanism that was used to determine syntactical relations (e.g. Declension of Cases make possibile to have valid "S-P-O-C", "P-S-O-C", "S-O-C-P", "C-P-S-O", "O-P-C-S" order depending on the speaker will)
   - If the home/foreign language does every type of predication with the Verb, then the syntactical relations possibly could be downgraded from "S-P-O-C" (Subject-Predicate-Object-Complements) to SVO (Subject Verb Object) doing some compensations (multplying categories, explaing particular cases).
   - The difficulty fot the student which downgraded to SVO model, that dealing with ancient languages like Greek or Hebrew, it will find out that nominal predication do not need explicit verb (Greek), and passing to Hebrew it will learn that the most easy/common way to speak about present facts, is to use non-verbal predication (i.e. building meaningful sentences without a verb)
     - adverbial predication (I .. in house, You ... there),
     - adjectival predication (the man... beautiful)
     - participial predication (the old man ... hard working in the eyes of his wife)
 
The good manuals I had dedicated an introductory chapter to syntax, but even that was not enough for many. My professors told me to read them at home or provide some materials to read at home, at that's it because there is no time to at the begining to explain it, yet some of them ask for it. 
Studing in Greek III the syntax, I have seen that this questions actually were not very difficult, and can be taught to the newbies. The best method in that sense is tutoring; I found out that providing an algorithm for analysis helps (
 - look for verbs 
 - how many verbs, how many predicates
 - where are their subjects, where are their objects
 - are there other complements, etc.

This website was meant as a "starter" on a journey of learning about syntax. I passed on what I have received from my teacher, and what I saw as important point, acknowleding that it could be said with more clarity, which probably at this stage I do not have yet over this enormous camp.
